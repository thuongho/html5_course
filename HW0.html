	<h3 style="text-align: center">Does advertising create inappropriate, unhealthy &amp; immoral products?</h3>
	<hr />
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder rumbles through the ominous clouds and strikes of lightning crackles here and there (somehow it always does), as a tall dark mysterious figure appear.  A clone no less of James Dean unraveling from the depths of the shade and sparking every girls' curiosity and interest.  As the girls peek out with dreamy looks in their eyes, to get a taste of this delinquent juvenile in action, he pulls out a cigarette and puffs a cloud of smoke.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How cool is that?!  Role-playing over and over the image of me puffing a cigarette like a magician captivating an audience of beautiful girls has made me considered buying some cigarettes.  Who knew...  Who knew that years later, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention pushed an ad reporting <em>"...that tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, causing more than 440,000 deaths each year..." (<a href="www.rochester.edu">www.rochester.edu)</a></em> 
	</p>
	<p>	 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That delinquent was probably stricken with tons of health diseases related to smoking down the road, but at that moment, he was king of the world.  His aura of coolness from smoking was nothing more than an advertisement.  Cigarette was probably an inappropriate, unhealthy and immoral product at its birth.  However, it is up to the advertising of how to spin the product or rather what to reveal to the public.  In this case, the product had innate unhealthy features before the advertising created its unhealthy image.
